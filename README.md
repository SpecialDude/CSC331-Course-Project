## Research on Scripting Languages - by GROUP 2 (CSC 331 2021/2022)

> As part of our research on scripting languages, we provided a Case Study on the Python Programming Language developed by Guido Van Rossum in 1991 (initial release date: February 20, 1991) and topics such as Lexical Analysis, Syntax Analysis, Compilation into Bytecodes and Interpretation are discussed.

As of interest, the team decided to work on:
- A Python Lexical Analyzer and
- A Python Interpreter

This repository contain the sources for a simple python lexer program and an Interpreter(still under developement).
